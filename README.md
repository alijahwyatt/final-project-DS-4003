*Description of Dashboard: My dashboard visualizes data of used cars from https://www.cars.com. The first visualization is a faceted bar chart that uses a multi-select dropdown, which looks the relationship between brands, average mileage of each brand, and transmission type. The second is a scatterplot, which uses a year range slider and a multiselect dropdown, allowing you to look at prices of selected brands over any number of years. The third is a data table which uses a single-select dropdown, allowing you to get a more in-depth view of the vehicles listed of a desired brand. My motivation for building the dashboard stems for interest in cars and I built the dashboard for those that want to look at different aspects of used cars for sale, whether look at potential cars to buy, or just out of curiosity of seeing what type of cars are listed for sale.
